Data Analysis & Visualization with Python – Restaurant Data

📌 Project Overview

This project applies Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques to a dataset provided by the professor. The focus was on three areas:

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, structuring, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Data Visualization – Building effective charts and visual summaries of key insights.

Code Description & Logic – Documenting our Python workflow with clear explanations and comments for reproducibility.

The deliverables include a Colab-compatible Jupyter Notebook and a video presentation explaining our approach.

🔎 Project Components
1. Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Standardized variable types and normalized features where necessary.

Ensured the dataset was consistent and analysis-ready before modeling.

2. Data Visualization

Built descriptive statistics and exploratory plots to uncover patterns.

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, including:

Distribution plots.

Correlation heatmaps.

Category comparisons and trend lines.

Visualizations were designed to highlight key findings and support conclusions.

3. Code Description & Logic

The notebook follows a step-by-step structure with markdown explanations.

Each major block of code is well-commented, ensuring readability and replicability.

Code workflow includes:

Importing and preparing data.

Applying statistical analysis.

Visual storytelling with Python.
